        <p class="bio1">
            Innocent is originally from Africa in a country called Rwanda. When I was young my
            dream was to become a businessman so that I can buy a house for my family. I developed the love of
            technology when I touched a computer for the first time at the university. I started saving money to buy
            myself a laptop. In 2016, I started a project which was teaching young women in Rwanda to learn basic
            computer skills and in 2017, coding skills were starting to be introduced in Rwanda and I started a
            coding boot camp for young girls to learn coding skills with help from my schoolmate who was in computer
            science and project grow up and become huge. </p>

        <p class="bio2"> After two months of running the program, the USA Embassy
            was interested in my project and accepted to give us the grant to recruit more young women. In 2018, I
            moved to USA, Columbus, OH. My wish was to dive into tech and I started searching for the boot camps
            around in Columbus and I found We Can CODE IT, a five-start coding Bootcamp located in Columbus OH. I
            joined the boot camp where I am currently working to complete my full stack developer program. </p>
